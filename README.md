## 📖 Concept Overview
Current Transformer architectures (like GPT) lack the energy efficiency and adaptive attention mechanisms found in biological brains. 

**"Brain-Constrained Transformer"** is my proposed research direction for the Master's program. It aims to integrate biological constraints into the Transformer architecture to improve **AI Alignment** and **Interpretability**.

### Key Research Questions
1.  **Sparsity:** Can we replace the dense attention matrix with sparse, dynamic connectivity inspired by neural circuits?
2.  **Recurrence:** Incorporating working memory (PFC-like dynamics) into feed-forward Transformers.
3.  **Active Inference:** Can we frame the "Attention" mechanism as an information-seeking policy minimizing free energy?

##  Related Work
My current research focuses on the biological side of this equation—modeling how the brain shifts attention to maximize information gain.
